## 🎨 Features

- **Full-screen scalable background image**  
  A high-resolution Unsplash image blended with gradient overlays for readability and contrast.

- **Image-free interactive buttons**  
  Custom-styled, gradient-based navigation buttons that visually change on hover and active states using pure CSS transitions.

- **Rollover menu animation**  
  Each navigation button uses the `::before` pseudo-element to create smooth color transitions and hover effects without using external images.

- **Responsive layout**  
  The design adjusts gracefully across all screen sizes — desktop, tablet, and mobile.

- **Clean typography and motion**  
  Uses Poppins font, subtle shadows, and fade-in text animations for an elegant aesthetic.
